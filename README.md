# Snap 'n Dash
Mobile application employing user-generated camera images to seamlessly generate platformers utilizing Unity, Android Studio, and Google Cloud Vision API.

## Overview
Snap 'n Dash was inspired by an experience we shared as children: imagining a character running across rooftops, car tops, and other obstacles. We wanted to make this experience a reality by allowing users to seamlessly create a strategy platformer game based off the world around them. Our project employs many different resources, primarily utilizing the Google Cloud Vision API, Unity, and Android Studio. 

## Implementation
* The object detection is implemented in Python 3.6
* The Android application is implemented in Java
* The game engine (Unity) uses C# 

## Usage
We aim to release the application to the Android app store.
